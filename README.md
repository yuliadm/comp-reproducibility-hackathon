# comp-reproducibility-hackathon


## Setting description
* Trying to run the code and reproduce the code from https://github.com/GeertvanGeest/V-pipe/blob/master/docs/tutorial_sarscov2.md
* env 'comprepr' created, running in main branch: (comprepr) @yuliadm ‚ûú /workspaces/comp-reproducibility-hackathon (main)  
* **System specs:** Windows10, Visual Studio Code (recent), Github Codespaces, mobile internet connection


1. `V-pipe`, `bioconda` and snakemake installation.
a. installed `pip` just in case
b. installation using the `quick_install.sh` script
- the script gets installed
- `bash quick_install.sh -p vp-analysis -w work` raises Warning and an Error:

```bash
Oops:You have conda or modules automatically loaded in your profile. This is can lead to potential conflicts and errors.
consider always loading such environment modifiers either manually or at the beginning of your jobs, never in your profile.

Then, use ./vpipe to run V-pipe.


Installation of V-pipe completed

```

The structure of the project (pipeline) that I am getting right after the installation is different from that reported in the tutorial https://github.com/GeertvanGeest/V-pipe/blob/master/docs/tutorial_0_install.md (maybe to the installation issues at the previous steps):

2. Checking installation by running

```bash

# copy the example data from the repository to your working directory
cp -r ../V-pipe/docs/example_HIV_data/* .
# check what will be run with a dry run
./vpipe -n
# run vpipe on a small HIV test dataset
# this will install all dependencies and run the pipeline
./vpipe 
```

After downgrading the python version and the snakemake, 

```bash
mamba install -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake=7.32.4 --strict-channel-priority -y
```

still getting an error: 

```bash

Explicitly install dropbox.

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge dropbox=11.36.2 -y
mamba install -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake=7.32.4 --strict-channel-priority -y
```

Getting tons of incompatibility messages.

2.‚ÄØTry installing snakemake-minimal
```bash
mamba install -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake-minimal=7.32.4 --strict-channel-priority -y
```

Alternative: try installing snakemake==7.32.4
```bash
pip install snakemake==7.32.4
```
Issues:

  DEPRECATION: Building 'connection_pool' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'connection_pool'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

```


Snakemake is now being found and executed, but hitting a new error:
```bash
AttributeError: module 'pulp' has no attribute 'list_solvers'. Did you mean: 'listSolvers'?
```

**Fix:** downgrade pulp to a version compatible with snakemake 7.32.4. The recommended version is `pulp==2.6.0`: pip install pulp==2.6.0

The dry run seems to be working after some tinkering. 
Trying the small HIV sample by running `bash ./vpipe`.

Results in 
```bash
Error: you need to specify the maximum number of CPU cores to be used at the same time. If you want to use N cores, say --cores N or -cN. For all cores on your system (be sure that this is appropriate) use --cores all. For no parallelization use --cores 1 or -c1. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stderr>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>
```


This error means that Snakemake (via mamba) is trying to create a new conda environment at a location where a non-conda folder already exists. This is a common issue when a previous run failed or left behind a corrupted or incomplete environment folder.

**Possible fix:**
1. Delete the problematic folder (/workspaces/comp-reproducibility-hackathon/vp-analysis/work/.snakemake/conda/99a95ea7e61fb60b56576f80acbc6acc_) so mamba/conda can recreate it cleanly.
2. Re-run your pipeline command `snakemake -s ../V-pipe/workflow/Snakefile --use-conda --cores 4`

Still getting an error:

```bash
CreateCondaEnvironmentException:

Output:

Didn't manage to solve the above after several iterations.
